## Call for Proposals (2nd ZKProof Workshop in Berkeley)

- **Title:** Generation of Twisted Edwards Elliptic Curves for Circuit Use.

- **Authors:** Barry WhiteHat, Jordi Baylina and Marta Bell√©s.

- **Date:** 20th of May of 2019.

- **Description:** The document contains a proposal for deterministically generate secure twisted Edwards Elliptic curves for arithmetic circuits. The document was updated after the recommendations and feedback from the zero-knowledge community at the [2nd ZKProof Workshop](https://zkproof.org/workshop2/main.html), which took place in Berkeley.
